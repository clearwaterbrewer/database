Pi Zero W or 3b with power connection
wifi information
way to see the mac-addr (router access to dhcp table)


etcher installed:
https://etcher.io/

Use Etcher to burn image to SD card, when complete, eject, wait a second or two, and reinsert SD card.

Ignore errors and open the new drive "/boot" in file manager.


Open a txt file such as issue.txt, delete all text in the file 

'Save As' ssh.txt

*****************
wireless option
*****************

Add the following to the empty text file (update the SSID and password) 

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="SSID"
    psk="password"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    id_str="Home Wifi"
} 

network={
    ssid="SSID2"
    psk="password2"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    id_str="Work Wifi"
} 

'Save As' wpa_supplicant.conf.txt

*****************
End Wireless option
*****************

Close the .txt file 

You now have a new files in the boot folder, ssh.txt (and wpa_supplicant.conf.txt (if using wireless)

Remove the .txt from the filename of both files (you will get warnings, do it anyway)
 *note - Raspbian will MOVE the files you added, but it did not delete them, it *used* them at boot.


Eject the SD card properly from the windows machine

Insert microSD into Pi Zero W and power up

*question - will "sudo apt install apache2 phpmyadmin" do most of the below?

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y

sudo sed -i  's/ServerTokens OS/ServerTokens Prod/' /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
sudo sed -i  's/ServerSignature On/#ServerSignature On/' /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
sudo sed -i  's/#ServerSignature Off/ServerSignature Off/' /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
//ServerTokens Prod tells apache to only return Apache in the Server header, returned on every page request.
//ServerSignature Off tells apache not to display the server version on error pages, or other pages it generates.
